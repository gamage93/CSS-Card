    <h4><b>RAMEN</b></h4> 
    <p>Despite ramen’s rising reputation, until fairly recently the word ramen (at least outside of Japan) was synonymous with instant ramen: the iconic Cup Noodles made famous worldwide by now-legendary Osaka entrepreneur Momofuku Ando.

Then the modern ramen boom began.

Much like sushi before it, shops specializing in ramen began to pop up in cities around the world. Nowadays, even non-foodies have come to realize that ramen can be much more than a cheap and convenient means of sustenance (though you’ll also find an astounding variety of instant ramen at convenience stores in Japan).

While some ramen evangelists — most notably chef David Chang — have proclaimed ramen to be “dead,” for noodle-lovers in Japan and worldwide it’s fair to say ramen is better than ever.</p>

    <h4><b>CURRY RICE</b></h4> 
    <p>Curry originates in Indian cuisine and was brought to Japan from India by the British. The Imperial Japanese Navy adopted curry to prevent beriberi, and now the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force's Friday menu is curry.[4] It is also nutritious, and easy to cook in mass quantity.[5] The dish became popular and available for purchase at supermarkets and restaurants in the late 1960s. Since the introduction of curry, it was reinvented to suit Japanese tastes and ingredients.[6] Japanese curry has little resemblance to curried dishes from other regions.[1] It was changed and adapted so much that it stands on its own as uniquely Japanese.[6] It is so widely consumed that it can be called a national dish.[1]</p>

    <h4><b>SUSHI</b></h4> 
    <p>A dish known as narezushi (????, ???, "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the Japanese practice of applying rice on raw fish.[6] The fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The first mention of sushi is in a Chinese dictionary thought to be from the 4th Century, in this instance referring to salted fish that had been placed in cooked or steamed rice, which caused it to undergo a fermentation process.[7] Fermentation methods following similar logic in other Asian rice cultures include prahok (??????), pla ra (??????), burong isda, sikhae (??), and amazake (??).[6][8]</p>
